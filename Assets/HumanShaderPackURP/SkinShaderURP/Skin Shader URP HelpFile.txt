Skin Shaders:

RRF_HumanShaders/Skin/RRF_HSP_URP_SkinBasic
-------------------------------------------------

BaseColourTint = Tint the overall material.
Desaturation = Move left for more Vibrant colour, more right for more grey colour

Albedo Texture = RGB Colour for the skin
Normal Map = RGB Normal Map (open GL)
Normal_BaseStrength = The power of the Normal Map (1 is the default)
SSSMap = RGBA Texture (Preferably a 32bit Targa Map)   A texture that holds the colour of the subsurface scatter, if you dont have one, use the Albedo texture
	If you do have one, the Alpha stores the Thickness, white where the areas of the skin are thin, like ears, nostrils and around the eyes.

SSS Mip = This blurrs the Textures to make the SSS effect Softer
Final SSS = The overall Power of the Sub Surface Scattering
SSS_FromAlpha = The amount that the SSS effect uses the Alpha channel of the SSS_Map texture, if not, it will borrow the red channel from the SSS Map used.
Smoothness = The smoothness of the skin (Gloss)
GlossMap = The Amount of Gloss (stored in the Alpha of the Texture) Metalness is RGB channels

LightPower = The amount the incoming light is magnified
BaseGlow = The amount the skin should have self illumination



RRF_HumanShaders/Skin/SimpleSSS6_URP
-------------------------------------------------

Actually these shaders have evolved more and are more comples than the Basic shaders above

MainLightTint = Tint the Incoming Light
Albedo_tint = Tine the Albedo Texture (good for making new skin tones)

Albedo (texture)
Desaturation = Move left for more Vibrant colour, more right for more grey colour
Normal Map = RGB Normal Map (open GL)
Metal-Gloss = RGBA (Metal is stored in RGB, Gloss stored in A)
SmoothnessDeviate = Changing the overall smoothness look

SSS-Texture-Weight(A) - RGBA Texture (Preferably a 32bit Targa Map)   A texture that holds the colour of the subsurface scatter, if you dont have one, use the Albedo texture
	If you do have one, the Alpha stores the Thickness, white where the areas of the skin are thin, like ears, nostrils and around the eyes.
SSS-WeightAmount = How much it uses the Alpha of the above texture
SSS_ToEmissive = Extra Glow for the SSS
ScatterColor = Attempts to tint the SSS but mainly overrode by the SSS texture colouring
Light_Bias,Scale,Scatter = Affects the way the Light affects the SSS areas
BackScatterPower = Affects the Light coming from behind

MicroDetail(NormalMap) =  A normal Map that can be tiles to act like skin texture/pores : examples are provided (SkinMicroB_Norm, SkinMicroD_Norm)
MicroDetail_Tiling,Offset,Power = Controls for the Micro Detail normal map

MakeUpMask 1+2
Each hold RGB values, thick of each Channel as a separate mask. These textures must correspond to the UVs of the model they are being applied to, your Character artists will understand these.
Mask1_Rchannel_Colour-Amount(A) = The Colour the Red Tones of Mask 1 should be changed to, and the Amount controlled by the Alpha amount of that.
respective for B
respective for G
Respective for Mask2
GlossAdjust = the Gloss amount for the Above channel masks.

Final Normal Map Power = Final Boost/reduction of the normal maps
BaseGlow = The colour maps are used as an emissive amount so the head wont go too dark in night time scenes.
SSS_Low = The lowest amount of Sub Surface Scattering
SSS_High = The highest amount of Sub Surface Scattering



RRF_HumanShaders/Skin/SimpleSSS6_Cutout_Basic_URP
-------------------------------------------------

Removed Makupcontrol for this shader, supplied Cutout Mask. (Single Sided shader)



For variations of shaders please get in touch. I like nice reviews, so in return for my helping you out, that is all I ask.

have an awesome day!
Thanks, Robert
