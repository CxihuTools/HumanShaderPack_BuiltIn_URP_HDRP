--------------------------------------------------

Version 1.1 - Dec 7th 2018

New Eye Shader Model 2 added with extra control and costomisable iris and pupil along with extra color and rotation control.
If using your own texture, be sure to set their wrap mode to Clamp in the texture inspector. This will ensure they do not tile over the eye
unless you intend to utilise it that way.

To use a custom pupil, be sure the 'Use custom pupil' check box is checked and inverting this pupil texture is optional for an experimental effect.
Iris and Pupil both have rotation speed sliders, set these to 0 if you do not want rotation.

IrisExtraDetail is where you will load in your custome Iris, this will overlay the Iris Base Color
Iris Extra Color - Amount is the color of the custom iris texture, the alpha slider controls the amount it is seen.

Currently the Custom Pupil is Black only and is the last to be drawn so will effectively hide the color detail underneath,
if in the case you do not see anything in the eye, reduce the Pupil Size slider to a small value.

LOD0 and LOD1 has been added.

--------------------------------------------------


Version 1.0 - Dec 2018

Use for medium-low spec characters, or even high ones if you wish. Optimized. Uses fake Caustics and Lens effects, intended for games and semi-realistic or cartoony styles.


Textures Supplied and required:

EyeExtras (RGB Mask) : (best not to change this, make a copy)
	Red: Ring
	Green: Scalera (redness+Veins)
	Blue: Iris Area Mask

IrisExtra: (Make a copy and make your own iris details!)
	A greyscale mask for the extra iris details

NormalMapBase: This is used for the lens effect, keep as is.

--------------------------------------------------

Shader Parameters:


Texture slots of those mentioned above.

EyeBallColor-Gloss(A) : The color of the main eyeball area and the gloss
is controlled by the alpha slider/amount.

Iris Color: The main Iris Color.

Iris Extra Color-Amount(A): The color of the IrisExtra Texture and the amount it is seen is controlled by the Alpha slider in the color.

Ring Color : The Color of the ring.

IrisGlow: Emissiveness of the overal iris coloring.

LensGloss: The Glossyness of the lens

LensPush: Uses the Normal Map to push the lens area to fake the lens effect.

Caustic Factor: Changes the Caustic Range of effect.

Pupil Size: The scale of the pupil
Pupil Width: <1 is more like a sheeps eye, >1 is more like a reptile eye, 1=perfectly round.

Veins: The amount of veins area seen (veins come from the Green channel of the EyeExtras Mask, they are multiplied by a red color internally).

--------------------------------------------------



Ten EyeBalls have been created as starting points, be sure to duplicate their materials to make your own so you can easily get back to a good starting point. Enjoy the video on YouTube via the Asset Store Page to get a better idea of how this works!

The Top 6 use the EyeShaderModel1
The Bottom 4 use the EyeShaderModel2
