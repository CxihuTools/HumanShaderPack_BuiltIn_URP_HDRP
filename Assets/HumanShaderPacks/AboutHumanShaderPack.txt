A set of Shaders for improved visualisation of Skin, Hair and Eyes. Ideally suited for characters.

HDRP - 7.18 (Uses latest SSS - Diffusion Profile lighting model)
URP + SRP included in their own folders (Mimic SSS for both models, URP will be refined as that lighting model stabilises)

Diffusion Profiles, Materials, Prefabs all premade as examples only. Results will depend on textures fed into the materials/shaders.

For more information and help in setting things up, you should contact me, my email is me@robertramsay.co.uk
I normally respond on the same day with a solution or video guidance if you need it. I do not respond well to reviews that are error
reports. Everything is working at point of submitting to the store where Unity also check compatibility on the submitted version.

HDRP Version - 2019.3.0f3
URP - 2019.3.0f3
SRP - 2018.4.14f1 LTS

These shaders are in constant development based on your feedback, get in touch, leave a nice review that reflects both the quality of 
the product and the help you have recieved as it will help me to grow and continue support! I want your games to look great too!
